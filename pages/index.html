    I currently am working as a UX Engineer at
    <a href="http://godaddy.com" rel="noopener" target="_blank" class="yellow"
      >GoDaddy</a
    >, which is where my passion for design and development converge. See my
    previous work history on

    >. Outside of work I have a beautiful wife and cat (obviously). I am also
    working on a few side projects including

  <h3>Services:</h3>

  <h4>UI/UX Design</h4>

  <p>
    UI/UX involves planning and iterating a site's structure and layout. Once
    the proper information architecture is in place, I design the visual layer
    to create a beautiful user experience.
  </p>

  <h4>Front End Development</h4>

  <p>
    Front End Development is building out the visual components of a website.
    Using HTML, CSS , and Javascript, I build fast, interactive websites. This
    also may include a CMS, API's or other integrations.
  </p>

  <h4>Product Development</h4>

  <p>
    The work that I am most interested in is 0-1 work (helping you get your idea
    into the world). A recent example of this is
    <a
      href="https://beta.omelo.com/"
      target="_blank"
      rel="noopener"
      class="yellow"
      >Omelo</a
    >
    a proof of concept that I built end to end (UI, back end business logic
    etc).
