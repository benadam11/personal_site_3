    which is where my passion for design and development converge. See my

  <h3>Services:</h3>

  <h4>UI/UX Design</h4>

  <p>
    UI/UX involves planning and iterating a site's structure and layout. Once
    the proper information architecture is in place, I design the visual layer
    to create a beautiful user experience.
  </p>

  <h4>Front End Development</h4>

  <p>
    Front End Development is building out the visual components of a website.
    Using HTML, CSS , and Javascript, I build fast, interactive websites. This
    also may include integrating a CMS.
  </p>

  <h4>Brand & Collateral Design</h4>

  <p>
    While most of my attention is on interactive projects, I do branding and
    collateral from time to time. This includes logo design, business cards, and
    other printed materials.
